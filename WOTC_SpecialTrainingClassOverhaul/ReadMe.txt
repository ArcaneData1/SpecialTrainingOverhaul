Results from checking IsResistanceHero:

resistance soldiers don't get extra item slot from armour
resistance soldiers don't activate those armor narrative moments
.and numerous other things... looks like a highlander change is required to make this work properly; could make a highlander PR which seperates Resistance Heroes from their new perk point system?
	or maybe just do a class override or something somewhere and switch some code around?



is new promotion screen by default necessary, as this mod's soldiers are resistance soldiers anyway?
